# Objects Demo in C\#

## Overview

This is a simple demonstration of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles using C#. 
The project illustrates how to define a class, create instances (objects) of that class, assign values to their properties, and invoke their methods.

The example is built around a `Human` class that has basic properties and methods to represent real-world behavior.

## Features

* Demonstrates the creation and use of a class (`Human`)
* Shows how to create multiple objects from a class
* Utilizes object fields (`Name`, `Age`) and methods (`Eat()`, `Sleep()`)
* Includes basic exception handling in the `Main` method

## Code Structure

* `Program.cs`

  * Contains the `Main` method where two `Human` objects are instantiated and used
* `Human` class

  * Fields: `Name`, `Age`
  * Methods: `Eat()`, `Sleep()`

## Example Output

```
James is eating.
James is sleeping.
Johnny is eating.
Johnny is sleeping.
```
